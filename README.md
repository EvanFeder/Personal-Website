# Personal-Website

My personal website, originally created in CMU's 98-177: Building Personal Websites but since upgraded from a template using React.

You can find the site at https://evanfeder.com/.

The initial template that I am in progress of customizing can be found at https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template.
